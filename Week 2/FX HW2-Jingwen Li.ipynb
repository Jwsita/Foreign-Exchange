    "While it is often the case that South Korean won deposit rates are lower than USD deposit rates for a particular maturity, the covered interest parity principle may not always hold true in the case of a non-deliverable currency like the KRW. This is because overseas investors may not be able to borrow at the deposit rate of the KRW due to restrictions on currency convertibility or lack of access to the Korean domestic banking system.\n",
